# Practice Assignment
The objective of the assignment is to design the unit module of a pattern in 2D and then familiarize yourself with 3D space by arraying the module in the x, y, and z directions.  Consider experimenting with hatching and boolean operations.  As you array the module practice transformations (i.e. rotate, scale) to achieve some variation amongst the arrayed modules.  The template file contains the wireframe model of a cube.  Please contain your arrayed modules within this cube.  Please upload your completed model to the link above. 
The filename should include your name.
