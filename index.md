# Introduction to Rhino

## Course Description
Introduction to 3D modeling techniques using Rhino 3D—a powerful, versatile modeling software program 
applicable to design fields including architecture, sculpture, and interior, furniture product, and jewelry design. 
Rhino is intuitive, easy to learn, and compatible with many other software packages. A wide array of plug-ins 
provide for an ever-evolving range of functions with Rhino. In-class projects enables students to learn the 
fundamentals of digital design beginning with 2D drawing and progressing to 3D volumetric modelling. Students 
will also gain experience in translating digital models into physical objects using digital fabrication methods, 
including laser cutting and 3D printing. Digital modelling skills developed in this class provide students with a 
“toolkit” that serves as a foundation for further mastery of this important industry software.
